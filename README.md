## Employee Tracker

## Description


The motivation I had behind this project was to see and tewst my knowledge of using SQL within javascript through the sql2 npm package. The purpose of this project is to manage the different databases that a company might be using in order to organize their different departments, employees and their respective roles. The different things which I learnt were for example how to make a query and update based on what you want completed.
